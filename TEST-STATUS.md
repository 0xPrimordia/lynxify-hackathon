# Test Status Summary

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for testing:

```
# Hedera Credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPERATOR_ID=0.0.12345
OPERATOR_KEY=302e020100300506032b657004220420db484b828e64b2d8f12ce3c0a0e93a0b8cce7af1bb8f39c97732394482538e10

# HCS Topics
NEXT_PUBLIC_HCS_GOVERNANCE_TOPIC=0.0.12346
NEXT_PUBLIC_HCS_AGENT_TOPIC=0.0.12347
NEXT_PUBLIC_HCS_PRICE_FEED_TOPIC=0.0.12348

# Legacy Topic Names (still used in some places)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOVERNANCE_TOPIC_ID=0.0.12346
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_TOPIC_ID=0.0.12347

# Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3001

# Testing Flags
BYPASS_TOPIC_CHECK=true
```

## Working Tests

The following tests are now passing:

- Basic verification tests (src/__tests__/basic-verification.test.ts)
- Environment check tests (src/__tests__/environment-check.test.ts)
- Hedera service tests (src/__tests__/services/hedera.test.ts)
- Token service tests (src/__tests__/services/token-service.test.ts)
- Most event-emitter tests (src/__tests__/services/event-emitter.test.ts)

## Remaining Issues

### Integration Tests

The integration tests (error-handling-recovery.test.ts and client-agent-flows.test.ts) need more work:

1. **Private Key Validation**: The tests attempt to use real Hedera SDK components which need properly formatted private keys.
2. **EventBus Implementation**: The EventBus mock doesn't fully match the actual implementation, particularly for `onceEvent`.
3. **Service Dependencies**: The WebSocketServer, TokenizedIndexService, and other services have complex dependencies.

### E2E Tests

The e2e/websocket-ui-flow.test.ts has React/JSX syntax errors that need to be addressed if we want to run these tests.

## Next Steps

1. Focus on getting the unit tests working first
2. Create more specific mocks for the services instead of trying to use the real implementations
3. Isolate tests from external dependencies like Hedera API
4. Consider adding a test-specific configuration for environment variables and dependency injection
