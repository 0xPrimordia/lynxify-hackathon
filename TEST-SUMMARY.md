## Fixed Issues

We have successfully fixed the following issues:

1. **Timer-Related Issues**:
   - Added NODE_ENV=test detection to disable timers in test environment
   - Added explicit timer cleanup methods to services
   - Set up proper Jest setup file to handle environment variables
   - Implemented force exit in test scripts to handle dangling timers

2. **Test Script Organization**:
   - Created separate scripts for different test categories
   - Isolated React component tests with a separate configuration
   - Created scripts for running simple E2E and integration tests

3. **Test Isolation**:
   - Configured tests to clean up resources after each test
   - Used fake timers in tests to control timing
   - Added shutdown functions to properly clean up services

## Remaining Issues

The following issues still need to be addressed:

1. **Variable Initialization Order**:
   - HCS10Protocol and TokenizedIndex tests have variable initialization issues
   - Mock function references are accessed before they're initialized

2. **Method Name Mismatches**:
   - Some integration tests expect `sendMessage` but the implementation uses different method names
   - Need to update mocks to match current implementation

3. **React Component Tests**:
   - Need proper JSX environment setup
   - TypeScript configuration for React syntax
   - React component mocks need to be properly set up

## Next Steps

1. Focus on fixing the variable initialization issues in service tests
2. Update integration tests to use correct method names
3. Set up a proper React testing environment for component tests

## Test Commands

Use the following commands to run different test categories:

```bash
# Core functionality tests
npm run test:core            # Run core services, API, types, and utils tests

# Individual test categories
npm run test:services        # Test core agent functionality
npm run test:agents          # Test agent services
npm run test:api             # Test API endpoints
npm run test:types           # Test type definitions
npm run test:utils           # Test utility functions

# Simple tests that work reliably
npm run test:e2e-simple      # Run basic E2E tests
npm run test:integration-simple  # Run basic integration tests

# React component tests (currently needs setup)
npm run test:react           # Run React component tests
```
