# Unified Lynxify HCS-10 Agent Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines a unified architecture for the Lynxify tokenized index agent with Moonscape integration via the HCS-10 protocol. It consolidates the previously separate implementations and provides a clear roadmap for developing a cohesive agent system that both leverages the HCS-10 protocol for communication and implements the business logic for the Lynxify tokenized index.

## Problem Statement

The current implementation has two disconnected systems:

1. **Business Logic Implementation** (`AgentManager` & related classes)
   - PriceFeedAgent, RiskAssessmentAgent, RebalanceAgent
   - HederaService for basic Hedera communication
   - No integration with HCS-10 protocol standards

2. **HCS-10 Protocol Implementation** (`HCS10Agent` & related classes)
   - Connection handling, message parsing, protocol-compliant formatting
   - No integration with tokenized index business logic
   - Runs separately from the main business logic

This disconnected approach results in:
- Duplicate code for Hedera communication
- Inability to process HCS-10 messages for business logic purposes
- Incomplete implementation of Moonscape requirements
- Deployment issues when running on Render

## Reference Documentation

This document builds upon the following existing documentation:

- [MOONSCAPE-AGENT-REGISTRATION.md](MOONSCAPE-AGENT-REGISTRATION.md) - Details the registration process for HCS-10 agents
- [MOONSCAPE-AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION.md](docs/MOONSCAPE-AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION.md) - Outlines the complete implementation requirements for HCS-10 agents
- [README.md](README.md) - outlines the client side demo of the rebalancing flow

**Important**: All functionality described in these documents must be preserved in the unified architecture.

## Architecture Goals

The unified architecture should:

1. Provide a **single agent implementation** that handles both HCS-10 protocol communication and business logic
2. Allow tokenized index operations to be triggered by HCS-10 messages
3. Support the client-side demo functionality described in the README
4. Maintain compliance with the Moonscape HCS-10 specification
5. Run reliably in both development and production (Render) environments

```

#### 1.1 LynxifyAgent

A new unified agent class that:
- Acts as the central coordinator
- Implements the HCS-10 protocol interface
- Delegates business logic operations to specialized services
- Maintains a single connection to Hedera
- Handles all HCS message processing

#### 1.2 HCS10ProtocolService

A service that:
- Handles all HCS-10 specific protocol requirements
- Manages connections to other agents
- Serializes/deserializes HCS-10 messages
- Maintains compliance with the Moonscape registry

#### 1.3 TokenizedIndexService

A service that:
- Implements all tokenized index business logic
- Handles rebalancing operations
- Manages token weights and ratios
- Processes governance proposals
- Executes token operations on the Hedera Token Service

#### 1.4 SharedHederaService

A consolidated Hedera service that:
- Provides a single client connection to Hedera
- Handles all topic creation and management
- Manages topic subscriptions
- Executes all Hedera transactions

### 2. Message Flow

The unified system will follow this message flow:

1. **Inbound Messages**:
   - Message arrives on agent's inbound topic
   - `HCS10ProtocolService` validates and parses the message
   - `LynxifyAgent` routes the message to the appropriate handler
   - `TokenizedIndexService` processes any business logic requests
   - Results are sent back via `HCS10ProtocolService`

2. **Outbound Messages**:
   - Business logic operations in `TokenizedIndexService` trigger events
   - `LynxifyAgent` converts events to HCS-10 messages
   - `HCS10ProtocolService` formats and sends messages
   - Messages are published to the appropriate topics

3. **Internal Events**:
   - Common event system shared across all components
   - Business logic can trigger protocol messages
   - Protocol messages can trigger business logic

### 3. File Structure

```

2. The WebSocket server will integrate with the unified agent
3. Agent status, messages, and events will be broadcast to the UI
4. Manual operations from the UI will trigger appropriate agent actions

## Conclusion

This unified architecture addresses the current limitations by:

1. Eliminating duplication between separate implementations
2. Properly integrating the HCS-10 protocol with business logic
3. Ensuring compliance with Moonscape requirements
4. Supporting the client-side demo functionality
5. Providing a reliable deployment approach for Render

By implementing this architecture, the Lynxify tokenized index agent will properly function as a Moonscape-compatible HCS-10 agent while executing the required business logic for index rebalancing and governance.

### Hedera Token Service (HTS) Integration Notes

While implementing the unified agent architecture, it's important to note that the Hedera Token Service (HTS) integration is considered lower priority compared to the agent and HCS flow components. The existing HTS functionality should be preserved as follows:

1. **Current HTS Implementation**
   - Basic token operations (mint, burn) are implemented in `TokenService`
   - HCS10-specific token operations are in `TokenServiceHCS10`
   - Demo operations show HCS to HTS flow with test tokens
   - No actual LYNX token minting/treasury operations (handled in a separate stack)

2. **HTS Integration Plan**
   - Integrate both `TokenService` and `TokenServiceHCS10` into the `LynxifyAgent`
   - Ensure WebSocket server exposes necessary HTS operations
   - Propagate token operation events through the `EventBus`
   - Provide client-side UI for token operation visualization

3. **WebSocket Server Integration**
   - Create handlers for token-related client requests
   - Relay token events from agent to clients
   - Support the existing demo flow for token operations
   - Implement proper error handling for token operations

This integration will ensure that the existing HTS demo functionality is preserved while maintaining focus on the core agent and HCS protocol implementation. Actual LYNX token management will remain separate as it's implemented in a different technology stack.

The unified agent architecture is now in a solid state with all core components integrated and communicating properly. We can proceed with implementing the business logic in Phase 3 with confidence that the foundation is robust and well-structured.
