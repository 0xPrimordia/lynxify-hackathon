# Unified Lynxify HCS-10 Agent Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines a unified architecture for the Lynxify tokenized index agent with Moonscape integration via the HCS-10 protocol. It consolidates the previously separate implementations and provides a clear roadmap for developing a cohesive agent system that both leverages the HCS-10 protocol for communication and implements the business logic for the Lynxify tokenized index.

## Problem Statement

The current implementation has two disconnected systems:

1. **Business Logic Implementation** (`AgentManager` & related classes)
   - PriceFeedAgent, RiskAssessmentAgent, RebalanceAgent
   - HederaService for basic Hedera communication
   - No integration with HCS-10 protocol standards

2. **HCS-10 Protocol Implementation** (`HCS10Agent` & related classes)
   - Connection handling, message parsing, protocol-compliant formatting
   - No integration with tokenized index business logic
   - Runs separately from the main business logic

This disconnected approach results in:
- Duplicate code for Hedera communication
- Inability to process HCS-10 messages for business logic purposes
- Incomplete implementation of Moonscape requirements
- Deployment issues when running on Render

## 4. Message Handling

The unified architecture implements a structured approach to message handling across the HCS-10 protocol. This section details the specific message flow, processing, and error handling mechanisms.

### 4.1 Message Types and Structure

#### HCS-10 Protocol Messages
- **Connection Messages**: Messages for establishing connections between agents
  - Connection Request
  - Connection Response
  - Connection Update
- **Command Messages**: Messages for executing operations
  - Direct Command
  - Broadcast Command
- **Query Messages**: Messages for requesting information
  - Agent Information Query
  - Status Query
  - Capability Query
- **Notification Messages**: Messages for broadcasting updates
  - Status Update
  - Event Notification

All messages follow the standard HCS-10 protocol format:
```json
{
  "p": "hcs-10",
  "op": "<operation_type>",
  "operator_id": "<topic_id>@<account_id>",
  "data": "<message_data>",
  "m": "<optional_memo>"
}
```

### 4.2 Message Processing Pipeline

The architecture implements a robust message processing pipeline:

1. **Message Reception**: Messages are received from the HCS topics via Mirror Node subscriptions
2. **Message Parsing**: Raw message data is parsed and validated against the HCS-10 schema
3. **Operation Classification**: Messages are classified based on their operation type
4. **Specialized Handling**: Each message type is routed to the appropriate handler
5. **State Updates**: Message processing results in state updates in the ConnectionsManager
6. **Response Generation**: Appropriate responses are generated and sent when needed

### 4.3 Connections Management

The architecture uses the `ConnectionsManager` class from the standards-sdk to handle all connection-related operations:

#### Key Responsibilities
- Tracking connection states (pending, established, closed)
- Managing connection requests and responses
- Preventing duplicate connection establishments
- Providing access to active and pending connections
- Updating connection status based on message processing

#### Connection States
- **Pending**: Connection request sent, waiting for confirmation
- **Needs Confirmation**: Connection request received, waiting for agent approval
- **Established**: Connection confirmed and active
- **Closed**: Connection explicitly or implicitly terminated

### 4.4 Implementation Details

#### Initializing the ConnectionsManager
```typescript
import { ConnectionsManager } from '@hashgraphonline/standards-sdk';

// Initialize within the agent
this.connectionsManager = new ConnectionsManager({
  client: this.client, // HCS10Client instance
  logLevel: 'info',
  prettyPrint: true
});

// Set the agent's account and topic information
await this.connectionsManager.setAgentInfo({
  accountId: this.agentId,
  inboundTopicId: this.inboundTopicId,
  outboundTopicId: this.outboundTopicId
});

// Load existing connections
await this.connectionsManager.fetchConnectionData(this.agentId);
```

#### Processing Messages
```typescript
// Process incoming messages
const processMessages = async (messages) => {
  // Handle connection messages via ConnectionsManager
  this.connectionsManager.processInboundMessages(messages);
  
  // Process connection requests that need confirmation
  await this.processConnectionRequests();
  
  // Process standard messages for established connections
  for (const message of messages) {
    if (isStandardMessage(message)) {
      await this.processStandardMessage(message);
    }
  }
};
```

#### Handling Connection Requests
```typescript
// Example function to handle connection requests
const handleConnectionRequest = async () => {
  // Get connections needing confirmation
  const pendingRequests = this.connectionsManager.getPendingRequests();
  
  for (const request of pendingRequests) {
    // Approve the connection (or implement custom approval logic)
    const connectionTopic = await this.connectionsManager.acceptConnectionRequest({
      requestId: request.id,
      memo: 'Connection accepted'
    });
    
    // Log the new connection
    console.log(`New connection established: ${connectionTopic}`);
  }
};
```

### 4.5 Chat Message Handling

The standard examples handle chat messages in the following way:

#### 1. Extracting Message Content
```typescript
// Extract content from a message
const extractMessageContent = (message) => {
  // If message has a data field as string
  if (typeof message.data === 'string') {
    // Check if it's JSON
    try {
      const parsedData = JSON.parse(message.data);
      return parsedData.text || parsedData.message || parsedData.content;
    } catch (e) {
      // If not JSON, use directly as content
      return message.data;
    }
  }
  
  // If message has a text field
  if (message.text) {
    return message.text;
  }
  
  // If data is an object
  if (typeof message.data === 'object') {
    return message.data.text || message.data.message || message.data.content;
  }
  
  return null;
};
```

#### 2. Processing Chat Message
```typescript
// Process standard chat message
const processStandardMessage = async (message) => {
  // Extract the content
  const content = extractMessageContent(message);
  if (!content) return;
  
  // Generate a response (could involve AI, logic, etc.)
  const responseText = await generateResponse(content);
  
  // Send response in proper HCS-10 format
  await sendResponse(message.origin_topic_id, responseText);
};
```

#### 3. Sending Response
```typescript
// Send a response to a chat message
const sendResponse = async (topicId, text) => {
  // Format as proper HCS-10 message
  const message = {
    p: 'hcs-10',
    op: 'message',
    text: text,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  };
  
  // Send through the HCS client
  await this.client.sendMessage(topicId, JSON.stringify(message));
};
```

#### 4. Message Processing Flow
- Connection messages are processed by ConnectionsManager
- Chat messages are processed only AFTER connection handling is complete
- All message sending follows the HCS-10 protocol format
- Message context is tracked by connection topic ID, not by sender

### 4.6 Best Practices from Standard Examples

The standards-expert-agent example demonstrates these key practices:

1. **Always use ConnectionsManager for connections**
   - Never implement your own connection tracking
   - Let ConnectionsManager handle all connection states
   
2. **Follow proper message sequence**
   - Process all messages through ConnectionsManager first
   - Then handle specialized message types
   
3. **Format all messages according to protocol**
   - Include required fields: `p`, `op`
   - Use standard operation types
   
4. **Track context by connection topic**
   - Maintain state for each connection
   - Send responses to correct connection topic
   
5. **Handle error cases gracefully**
   - Validate message format before processing
   - Provide fallbacks for missing data

### 4.7 Error Handling and Retries

The architecture implements robust error handling at multiple levels:

1. **Message-Level Validation**
   - Schema validation for all incoming messages
   - Proper operator_id validation
   - Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks

2. **Connection-Level Error Handling**
   - Handling connection conflicts
   - Managing duplicate connection requests
   - Detecting connection timeouts

3. **Network-Level Error Management**
   - Transient connectivity issues
   - Mirror node subscription recovery
   - Transaction submission retries

4. **Classification-Based Handling**
   - Critical errors (security-related)
   - Recoverable errors (retry-eligible)
   - Warning-level issues (non-fatal)

### 4.8 Port Binding Implementation

For Render and other cloud deployment platforms, proper port binding is critical. The implementation:

1. **Explicitly binds HTTP server to `0.0.0.0`** (required by Render)
2. **Uses the `PORT` environment variable** provided by the platform
3. **Creates a basic HTTP server early** in the initialization process
4. **Provides health check endpoints** on the bound port
5. **Shares the HTTP server instance** with the WebSocket service

Example implementation:
```typescript
// In unified-server.ts
const PORT = parseInt(process.env.PORT || '3000', 10);
console.log(`[Server] Creating HTTP server on port ${PORT} bound to 0.0.0.0`);

// Create HTTP server first (immediate port binding)
const httpServer = createServer((req, res) => {
  // Basic routing for health checks
  if (req.url === '/health' || req.url === '/') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
    res.end(JSON.stringify({ status: 'ok', timestamp: new Date().toISOString() }));
    return;
  }
  
  res.writeHead(404);
  res.end();
});

// Explicitly bind to 0.0.0.0 to make the port visible to Render's port scanner
httpServer.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`[Server] HTTP server running at http://0.0.0.0:${PORT}`);
});

// Pass the HTTP server to the WebSocketService
const webSocketService = new UnifiedWebSocketService(
  eventBus,
  lynxifyAgent,
  tokenService,
  tokenizedIndexService,
  httpServer // Pass the HTTP server instance
);
```

### 4.9 Render Deployment Requirements

When deploying to Render, several critical factors must be considered for successful port binding:

1. **Immediate Port Binding**:
   - Render requires a service to bind to a port within 60 seconds of startup
   - Port binding must be one of the first operations performed in your application
   - Failure to bind a port results in deployment termination

2. **Correct Host Binding**:
   - Always bind to `0.0.0.0` (not `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`)
   - Explicitly specify the host parameter when calling `listen()`
   - Example: `server.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {...})`

3. **Environment Variable Usage**:
   - Always use the `PORT` environment variable provided by Render
   - Provide a reasonable default (e.g., 3000) for local development
   - Example: `const PORT = parseInt(process.env.PORT || '3000', 10);`

4. **Health Check Endpoint**:
   - Implement a basic health check endpoint (e.g., `/health` or `/`)
   - Return a 200 status code and simple JSON response
   - Include this endpoint in your Render configuration (`healthCheckPath`)

5. **Order of Operations**:
   - Create and bind the HTTP server before initializing other services
   - Only start background processing after the server is listening
   - Use the `listening` event to trigger subsequent initialization

6. **Logging for Troubleshooting**:
   - Log port binding details explicitly (`Server listening on 0.0.0.0:${PORT}`)
   - Include timestamps in logs to track startup sequence
   - Log confirmation when binding succeeds

By following these requirements, you'll ensure that Render correctly detects your service as properly started and keeps it running.

### 4.10 HCS-10 Message Format Compliance

For proper interoperability with other HCS-10 agents, strict adherence to the standard message formats is essential. The following examples demonstrate correctly formatted messages for various operations:

#### Connection Request (from client to agent's inbound topic)
```json
{
  "p": "hcs-10",
  "op": "connection_request",
  "operator_id": "0.0.123456@0.0.789101",
  "m": "Request to connect to the Lynxify agent"
}
```

#### Connection Created (from agent to client via agent's outbound topic)
```json
{
  "p": "hcs-10",
  "op": "connection_created",
  "connection_topic_id": "0.0.567890",
  "connected_account_id": "0.0.789101",
  "operator_id": "0.0.123456@0.0.456789",
  "connection_id": 12345,
  "m": "Connection established"
}
```

#### Standard Message (on connection topic)
```json
{
  "p": "hcs-10",
  "op": "message",
  "operator_id": "0.0.567890@0.0.123456",
  "data": "{\"command\":\"getPrices\",\"tokens\":[\"BTC\",\"ETH\",\"HBAR\"]}",
  "m": "Price data request"
}
```

#### Message with Large Content (using HCS-1 reference)
```json
{
  "p": "hcs-10",
  "op": "message",
  "operator_id": "0.0.567890@0.0.123456",
  "data": "hcs://1/0.0.999999",
  "m": "Large content stored via HCS-1"
}
```

#### Close Connection (on connection topic)
```json
{
  "p": "hcs-10",
  "op": "close_connection",
  "operator_id": "0.0.567890@0.0.123456",
  "reason": "Conversation completed",
  "m": "Closing connection"
}
```

Implementing these message formats ensures compatibility with the broader HCS-10 ecosystem and allows your agent to communicate with any other standard-compliant agent.

### 4.11 Troubleshooting Chat Agent Responsiveness

The following measures were implemented to ensure reliable chat agent operation in production:

#### 4.11.1 Message Polling Optimization

For a responsive chat agent experience, the message polling frequency has been optimized:

1. **Reduced Polling Interval**: Message polling is configured for 10-second intervals instead of 60 seconds to provide faster response times.
2. **Immediate Initial Check**: Messages are checked immediately on startup rather than waiting for the first polling interval.
3. **Health Monitoring**: The agent actively monitors its health and activity, restarting if no message activity is detected for 15 minutes.

#### 4.11.2 Connection Handling Improvements

To manage the large number of connections effectively:

1. **Consistent Variable Naming**: Fixed inconsistent variable references between `connection` and `pendingRequest` in approval handlers.
2. **Auto-Approval Logic**: Simplified auto-approval logic to reduce potential points of failure.
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Added try/catch blocks around critical connection operations.
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed connection tracking with message count statistics.

#### 4.11.3 Diagnostic Tools

To identify and resolve communication issues:

1. **Debug Messages**: The agent regularly sends diagnostic messages to its outbound topic with connection statistics.
2. **Status File Updates**: Detailed status information is logged to disk for the wrapper process to monitor.
3. **Activity Tracking**: Last activity times are tracked to detect and recover from agent stalls.

#### 4.11.4 Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Causes | Solution |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| No response to messages | Polling interval too long | Reduce polling interval to 10 seconds or less |
| | Connection not established | Check connection status and send debug messages |
| | Message format mismatch | Ensure messages follow the proper HCS-10 format |
| Duplicate connections | Missing connection status updates | Implement proper connection tracking and cleanup |
| | ConnectionsManager not synchronized | Call `syncConnectionsFromManager()` after status changes |
| Agent crashes | Memory issues in ConnectionsManager | Implement health monitoring and automatic restarts |
| | Networking timeouts | Add robust error handling and retry logic |

#### 4.11.5 Recommended Configuration

For production deployment of chat functionality:

```javascript
// Polling configuration
const pollingIntervalMs = 10000; // 10 seconds for responsive chat
const connectionCheckIntervalMs = 30000; // 30 seconds for connection status

// Restart parameters (in restart-agent.mjs)
const INACTIVITY_THRESHOLD = 1000 * 60 * 15; // 15 minutes
const CHECK_INTERVAL = 1000 * 60 * 5; // Check every 5 minutes
```

By implementing these optimizations, the agent achieves reliable chat response while maintaining a stable connection to the Hedera network.

### 4.12 Testing HCS-10 Message Handling Locally

The following standardized testing approach should be used for validating HCS-10 message handling in the unified architecture:

#### 4.12.1 Official Testing Solution

The project includes a canonical testing tool that should be used for all HCS-10 protocol and message handling testing:

- **Tool**: `scripts/test-local-agent.mjs`
- **Usage**: `npm run test:local-agent`
- **Documentation**: `scripts/local-agent-usage.md`

This is the **only approved testing solution** for HCS-10 chat messages and connection handling. No additional test scripts should be created that duplicate this functionality.

#### 4.12.2 Test Client Capabilities

The official test client provides:

1. **Interactive command interface** for connection and message testing
2. **Protocol-compliant message formatting** that follows HCS-10 standards
3. **Message content extraction and display** using the same logic as the agent
4. **Connection lifecycle testing** (establish, message, close)
5. **Response monitoring** with proper message polling

#### 4.12.3 Testing Workflow

The standard testing workflow is:

1. Start the agent in one terminal: `npm run start:agent`
2. Run the test client in another terminal: `npm run test:local-agent`
3. Use the interactive commands to test all aspects of messaging:
   ```
   connect       # Establish connection
   send <text>   # Send a test message
   status        # Check connection status
   close         # Close the connection properly
   ```

#### 4.12.4 Validation Criteria

When testing chat message handling, verify:

1. **Connection establishment** works correctly
2. **Message parsing** extracts content properly
3. **Response generation** produces protocol-compliant messages
4. **Connection context** is properly maintained
5. **Error handling** gracefully manages issues

#### 4.12.5 Pre-Deployment Verification

Before deploying to production environments:

1. Run the local agent with the test client
2. Verify all message handling works correctly
3. Confirm no duplicate connections are created
4. Validate protocol compliance in all messages

This local testing approach eliminates the need to deploy to Render simply to test basic message handling functionality.

## This document builds upon the following existing documentation:

- [MOONSCAPE-AGENT-REGISTRATION.md](MOONSCAPE-AGENT-REGISTRATION.md) - Details the registration process for HCS-10 agents
- [MOONSCAPE-AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION.md](docs/MOONSCAPE-AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION.md) - Outlines the complete implementation requirements for HCS-10 agents
- [README.md](README.md) - outlines the client side demo of the rebalancing flow

**Important**: All functionality described in these documents must be preserved in the unified architecture.

## Architecture Goals

The unified architecture should:

1. Provide a **single agent implementation** that handles both HCS-10 protocol communication and business logic
2. Allow tokenized index operations to be triggered by HCS-10 messages
3. Support the client-side demo functionality described in the README
4. Maintain compliance with the Moonscape HCS-10 specification
5. Run reliably in both development and production (Render) environments

```

#### 1.1 LynxifyAgent

A new unified agent class that:
- Acts as the central coordinator
- Implements the HCS-10 protocol interface
- Delegates business logic operations to specialized services
- Maintains a single connection to Hedera
- Handles all HCS message processing

#### 1.2 HCS10ProtocolService

A service that:
- Handles all HCS-10 specific protocol requirements
- Manages connections to other agents
- Serializes/deserializes HCS-10 messages
- Maintains compliance with the Moonscape registry

#### 1.3 TokenizedIndexService

A service that:
- Implements all tokenized index business logic
- Handles rebalancing operations
- Manages token weights and ratios
- Processes governance proposals
- Executes token operations on the Hedera Token Service

#### 1.4 SharedHederaService

A consolidated Hedera service that:
- Provides a single client connection to Hedera
- Handles all topic creation and management
- Manages topic subscriptions
- Executes all Hedera transactions

### 2. Message Flow

The unified system will follow this message flow:

1. **Inbound Messages**:
   - Message arrives on agent's inbound topic
   - `HCS10ProtocolService` validates and parses the message
   - `LynxifyAgent` routes the message to the appropriate handler
   - `TokenizedIndexService` processes any business logic requests
   - Results are sent back via `HCS10ProtocolService`

2. **Outbound Messages**:
   - Business logic operations in `TokenizedIndexService` trigger events
   - `LynxifyAgent` converts events to HCS-10 messages
   - `HCS10ProtocolService` formats and sends messages
   - Messages are published to the appropriate topics

3. **Internal Events**:
   - Common event system shared across all components
   - Business logic can trigger protocol messages
   - Protocol messages can trigger business logic

### 3. File Structure

```

  app/
    services/
      lynxify-agent.ts         # Main unified agent

4. Begin implementation of the complete business logic in each service
5. Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically

## Conclusion

This unified architecture addresses the current limitations by:

1. Eliminating duplication between separate implementations
2. Properly integrating the HCS-10 protocol with business logic
3. Ensuring compliance with Moonscape requirements
4. Supporting the client-side demo functionality
5. Providing a reliable deployment approach for Render

By implementing this architecture, the Lynxify tokenized index agent will properly function as a Moonscape-compatible HCS-10 agent while executing the required business logic for index rebalancing and governance.

### Hedera Token Service (HTS) Integration Notes

While implementing the unified agent architecture, it's important to note that the Hedera Token Service (HTS) integration is considered lower priority compared to the agent and HCS flow components. The existing HTS functionality should be preserved as follows:

1. **Current HTS Implementation**
   - Basic token operations (mint, burn) are implemented in `TokenService`
   - HCS10-specific token operations are in `TokenServiceHCS10`
   - Demo operations show HCS to HTS flow with test tokens
   - No actual LYNX token minting/treasury operations (handled in a separate stack)

2. **HTS Integration Plan**
   - Integrate both `TokenService` and `TokenServiceHCS10` into the `LynxifyAgent`
   - Ensure WebSocket server exposes necessary HTS operations
   - Propagate token operation events through the `EventBus`
   - Provide client-side UI for token operation visualization

3. **WebSocket Server Integration**
   - Create handlers for token-related client requests
   - Relay token events from agent to clients
   - Support the existing demo flow for token operations
   - Implement proper error handling for token operations

This integration will ensure that the existing HTS demo functionality is preserved while maintaining focus on the core agent and HCS protocol implementation. Actual LYNX token management will remain separate as it's implemented in a different technology stack.

The unified agent architecture is now in a solid state with all core components integrated and communicating properly. We can proceed with implementing the business logic in Phase 3 with confidence that the foundation is robust and well-structured.

## 5. Deployment Architecture and Execution Flow

This section clarifies the deployment architecture and execution flow to avoid confusion about which files are used in various environments.

### 5.1 Current Production Deployment

The production deployment on Render uses the following execution flow:

1. **Entry Point**: `scripts/restart-agent.mjs`
   - This script is specified in `render.yaml` as the `startCommand`
   - It sets up a process monitoring wrapper that can restart the agent on failure
   - The script launches `scripts/hcs10/agent-handler.mjs`

2. **Agent Implementation**: `scripts/hcs10/agent-handler.mjs`
   - This is the actual HCS-10 agent implementation currently used in production
   - It creates an HTTP server bound to 0.0.0.0 to satisfy Render's port requirements
   - It handles HCS-10 connections, requests, and messaging
   - This implementation predates the unified architecture but has been updated with port binding

3. **Port Binding**:
   - The HTTP server in `agent-handler.mjs` binds to the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable (default: 3000)
   - It binds explicitly to host `0.0.0.0` as required by Render
   - The health check endpoint is available at `/health`

### 5.2 Unified Architecture Implementation

The unified architecture is implemented but not yet used in production:

1. **Entry Point**: `src/app/scripts/unified-server.ts`
   - This script can be run with `npm run unified-server`
   - It creates a proper HTTP and WebSocket server bound to 0.0.0.0
   - It initializes the unified architecture components

2. **Agent Implementation**: `src/app/services/lynxify-agent.ts`
   - This is the newer, unified agent implementation
   - It handles both HCS-10 protocol and business logic
   - It's not yet used in production

3. **Services**:
   - `src/app/services/hcs10-protocol.ts` - HCS-10 protocol handling
   - `src/app/services/tokenized-index.ts` - Business logic for the index
   - `src/app/services/unified-websocket.ts` - WebSocket interface for UI integration
   - `src/app/services/token-service.ts` - Token operations

### 5.3 NPM Scripts Map

The following npm scripts map to different entry points:

| npm script | Purpose | Implementation | Entry Point | Used In |
|------------|---------|----------------|------------|---------|
| `npm run start:agent` | Production agent | Legacy HCS-10 | `scripts/restart-agent.mjs` | Render production |
| `npm run unified-server` | Unified agent | Unified architecture | `src/app/scripts/unified-server.ts` | Development |
| `npm run start` | Legacy server | Combined server | `combined-server.js` | Legacy mode |
| `npm run demo` | Legacy demo | Combined server | `combined-server.js` | Legacy demo |
| `npm run demo:refactored` | Refactored demo | Unified architecture | `src/app/scripts/start-server.ts` | Development |
| `npm run agent` | Unified agent | Unified architecture | `dist/app/scripts/run-agent.js` | Development |
| `npm run rebalance-agent` | Rebalance agent | Specialized agent | `src/app/scripts/rebalance-agent.ts` | Development |
| `npm run hcs10:start-server` | HCS-10 server | Legacy HCS-10 | `scripts/start-hcs10-server.mjs` | Development |

### 5.4 Build Process

Different build processes are used for different parts of the architecture:

1. **Next.js UI Build**: `npm run build`
   - Builds the Next.js application for UI deployment
   - Used for the web interface

2. **Unified Server Build**: `npm run build-server`
   - Runs TypeScript compiler with `tsconfig.server.json`
   - Compiles unified architecture files to `dist/` directory

3. **HCS-10 Agent Build**: `npm run build:hcs10-agent`
   - Runs TypeScript compiler with `tsconfig.hcs10.json`
   - Compiles HCS-10 specific files to `dist-hcs10/` directory

4. **Scripts Build**: `npm run build-scripts`
   - Runs TypeScript compiler with `tsconfig.scripts.json`
   - Compiles utility scripts to `dist/` directory

### 5.5 Migration Plan

To transition from the legacy implementation to the unified architecture:

1. **Update render.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   startCommand: npx ts-node --compiler-options '{"module":"commonjs"}' src/app/scripts/unified-server.ts
   ```
   Or alternatively:
   ```yaml
   buildCommand: npm install && npm run build-server
   startCommand: node dist/app/scripts/unified-server.js
   ```

2. **Ensure Environment Variables**:
   - Make sure all required environment variables are set in render.yaml
   - Pay special attention to port-related variables

3. **Health Check Configuration**:
   - Ensure the health check endpoints are consistent

4. **Testing**:
   - Test locally with the unified architecture before deploying
   - Use the same port binding approach (0.0.0.0) in development
