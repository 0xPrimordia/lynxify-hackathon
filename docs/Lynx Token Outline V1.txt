Asset Allocation and Weighting Strategy
Introduction
The Hedera Index Fund is designed to provide diversified exposure to the Hedera ecosystem by utilizing a Market Capitalization Weighting strategy. This approach ensures that assets are allocated based on their market value, while maintaining industry-level balance through sector caps. The goal is to create a structured and adaptable fund that mitigates risk, optimizes growth potential, and remains flexible to market fluctuations.
Sector-Based Allocation
To achieve diversification, the fund is divided into five key sectors, each representing a distinct component of the Hedera ecosystem. Each sector is assigned a weighted allocation based on the total market capitalization of all tokens within it. However, to prevent over-concentration in any single sector, a maximum cap of 40% per sector is applied.
The five sectors included in the fund are:
Smart Contract Platforms – This sector includes Hedera's native asset (HBAR) along with wrapped versions of major blockchain assets, such as Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), and Wrapped Avalanche (WAVAX). These assets provide foundational stability and high liquidity.
DeFi & DEX Tokens – Tokens that power decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Hedera, such as SAUCE (SaucerSwap), xSAUCE, HBARX, and HLQT.
Stablecoins – Hedera-native and bridged stablecoins like USDC, USDT, DAI, and HCHF. These provide price stability and liquidity to the fund, ensuring smooth transactions and rebalancing.
Enterprise & Utility Tokens – Tokens representing business applications, sustainability initiatives, and tokenized launchpads, such as Calaxy (CLXY), DOVU, and HeadStarter (HST).
GameFi & NFT Infrastructure – Tokens supporting gaming finance, NFT marketplaces, and entertainment ecosystems, including Tune.FM (JAM), Karate Combat (KARATE), HashPack (PACK), GRELF, and STEAM.

Token Weighting Within Each Sector
Within each sector, individual tokens are weighted purely based on their market capitalization. Unlike traditional index funds that may impose caps at the token level, this fund allows the largest tokens within each sector to receive the highest weight. This method ensures that assets with strong market performance are proportionally represented in the portfolio.
The formula for token allocation within a sector is:
This dynamic approach allows token weights to naturally adjust over time, reflecting real market trends while keeping sector allocations balanced.

Weighting Industries (Sectors) by Market Cap
Each sector's weight in the total index fund is determined by its total market capitalization relative to the total market cap of all sectors.
Formula for Sector Weight Calculation:



Where:
= Weight of sector s in the total fund
= Total market cap of sector s
= Sum of all sector market caps
Example Calculation: Sector Weights

Total Market Cap of All Sectors = $30,000M
Thus, the sum of all sector weights must equal 100%.
Weighting Tokens Within a Sector by Market Cap
Once sector weights are determined, each token within a sector is also weighted by its market cap relative to the total market cap of that sector.
Formula for Token Weight Calculation (Inside a Sector)



Where:
= Weight of token t in its sector
= Market cap of token t
= Total market cap of all tokens in the sector
Example Calculation: Token Weights in Core Hedera & Smart Contract Platforms

Total Market Cap of Core Hedera Sector = $10,000M
Each token’s weight in the sector must sum to 100%.
Applying Sector Weights to Token Weights
Now that we have sector weights and token weights within each sector, we calculate the final weight of each token in the entire fund.
Formula for Final Token Weight in the Index Fund
Where:
= Final weight of token t in the entire index fund
= Weight of sector s in the fund
= Weight of token t in its sector
Example Calculation: Final Token Weights


For example, HBAR’s final weight in the fund:
This process repeats for every token in every sector, ensuring a fully market cap-weighted index fund.



Example Allocation
Using estimated market capitalizations, the following is an example of how the fund is structured:
Smart Contract Platforms (40%)

DeFi & DEX Tokens (20%)

Stablecoins (15%)



Enterprise & Utility Tokens (15%)

GameFi & NFT Infrastructure (10%)













Governance and Voting Mechanisms
Introduction
The Lynxify Index Fund is governed by a fully decentralized DAO, where community members propose and vote on changes. To ensure decentralization while preventing governance abuse, this chapter outlines the rules, constraints, and voting mechanics that govern the fund.
1. Voting on Fund Management

2. Voting on Token Weights Within Each Sector

3. Voting on Moving a Token to a Different Sector

4. Voting on Governance Mechanisms

5. Voting on Fee & Revenue Allocations

6. Safeguards Against Governance Manipulation



Governance Generation and Staking Model
Overview
Governance tokens serve as the foundation for decentralized decision-making within the Lynxify ecosystem. These tokens are earned through staking LXY tokens and allow users to participate in governance activities. To ensure fair distribution and prevent excessive accumulation, governance token holdings are capped at 96% of the user’s total LXY balance.
Governance Token Staking Model
Users generate governance tokens by staking their LXY holdings. The staking mechanism is designed to be straightforward, ensuring transparency and ease of understanding.
Formula for Governance Token Rewards
Governance tokens are earned at a fixed rate based on the user’s staked LXY tokens:


Where:
R_user = Governance tokens earned per period.
S_u = LXY tokens staked by the user.
r = Fixed reward rate per period (8% per month or 96% per year).
Example Calculation
If a user stakes 10,000 LXY, they earn:
800 governance tokens per month (8% per month).
9,600 governance tokens per year, reaching their maximum cap.
3. Governance Token Holding Cap
A user cannot hold more than 96% of their total LXY holdings in governance tokens. This ensures active participation in governance while preventing the hoarding of governance power.
Formula for Maximum Governance Tokens a User Can Hold


Where:
H_max = Maximum governance tokens a user can accumulate.
LXY_held = Total LXY tokens owned by the user.
Example Calculation
If a user holds 10,000 LXY:
They can accumulate up to 9,600 governance tokens.
If they exceed this amount, they must use governance tokens (via voting or other mechanisms) or increase their LXY holdings to continue earning.




Voting Mechanics

Proposal Submission Requirements
Users must stake governance tokens to submit a proposal. If the proposal passes, users receive their staked tokens back. If it fails, tokens are burned to discourage spam proposals.
Proposal Categories & Submission Thresholds


3. Quorum & Approval Thresholds
To prevent low voter participation from allowing governance attacks, each proposal type has a fixed quorum requirement based on total governance tokens (governance tokens) in circulation.
Formula for Required Votes


Where:
Vrequired= Minimum votes required to pass
T = Total governance tokens in circulation
P = Required approval percentage

Quadratic Voting Formula
In quadratic voting, the cost of casting VVV votes is proportional to the square of the votes cast:

Where:
CCC = Cost in governance tokens.
VVV = Number of votes cast.
This means voting power scales non-linearly, making it costly to concentrate votes on a single decision.
2. Example of Quadratic Voting
Let’s assume a user has 100 governance tokens and wants to vote on a proposal.

If a user wants 10 votes, they must spend 100 tokens, exhausting their balance.
If another user has 200 tokens, they could cast 14 votes (142=19614^2 = 196142=196), but not 15 votes since 152=22515^2 = 225152=225 would exceed their balance.



Encouraging Voting Participation
To ensure active governance participation, Lynxify’s voting system includes several incentives to reward engaged users and encourage meaningful decision-making.

Vote Refund Mechanism
Users who vote "Yes" on a successful proposal will receive their votes back, preventing loss of governance tokens when supporting beneficial changes.
Mechanics:
If a proposal passes, all users who voted “Yes” will have their spent governance tokens refunded.
If a proposal fails, the spent tokens are not refunded.
This encourages voters to carefully support proposals with strong community backing while discouraging spam voting.
Example Calculation:
User votes 10 governance tokens on a proposal.
The proposal passes → User gets back all 10 tokens.
The proposal fails → Tokens are spent permanently.

Monthly Voting Bonus – Increased Earnings Cap
Users who vote on any proposal within a given month will see an increase in their maximum governance tokens earned per month.
Mechanics:
Normal governance earnings cap: 8% per month.
If a user votes on any proposal that month: Cap increases to 10% for the next month.
This rewards consistent voter engagement and encourages users to regularly participate in governance decisions.
Example Calculation:
User holds 10,000 LXY → Normally earns 800 governance tokens per month (8%).
If they vote, next month they earn 1,000 governance tokens (10%) instead.

Increased Governance Token Cap for Active Voters
To further incentivize governance participation, users who vote regularly will have an increased governance token holding cap.
Mechanics:
Default cap: Users can hold up to 96% of their LXY balance as governance tokens.
Active voter cap: Users who vote on at least one proposal per month can hold up to 120% of their LXY balance in governance tokens.
Example Calculation:
A user with 10,000 LXY normally has a cap of 9,600 governance tokens (96%).
If they vote in a given month, their cap increases to 12,000 governance tokens (120%).
This encourages long-term governance participation.

Summary of Encouragement Mechanics


This system ensures active participation in governance, rewards engaged users, and prevents hoarding, creating a decentralized and fair voting process.








Conclusion
This governance framework ensures full decentralization while keeping protection mechanisms in place to prevent manipulation.The community has complete control over fund mechanics within boundaries, allowing dynamic but secure governance.  While still retaining the original ethos of diversification.
